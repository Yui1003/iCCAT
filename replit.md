# CVSU CCAT Campus Navigation App

## Project Overview
Comprehensive campus wayfinding/navigation web application with kiosk and mobile QR-code versions. Features interactive campus maps, multi-phase route navigation with color-coded paths, ETA calculations, admin management tools, feedback collection, analytics tracking, and offline support. Deployed on Render with Firebase backend; Replit used for testing before production deployment.

## Recent Changes (Nov 25, 2025) - EXISTING PATHS VISUALIZATION + ZOOM IMPROVEMENT + SEARCH & FILTERING ✅

### Maps - Stable Zoom + Fixed Tile Loading 🔍✅

#### Path Drawing Map 
- **Issues Fixed**:
  1. Map tiles showing artifacts at high zoom levels (OSM only supports up to zoom 19)
  2. Map zooming out every time a node was added, forcing users to re-zoom
  
- **Solutions Applied**:
  1. **Proper tile loading**: Used `maxNativeZoom: 19` to allow tiles to scale beyond their native resolution up to zoom 22
  2. **Preserve zoom level**: Only fit bounds on initial load with existing nodes, not on every node addition
  3. **Better initial zoom**: Set default zoom to 18 for better starting perspective
  4. **Full zoom range**: Enabled zoom levels up to 22 for precise node placement
  
- **Result**: 
  - Clean, artifact-free map tiles at all zoom levels
  - Zoom in up to level 22 for accurate node placement
  - Users can zoom in and pan freely without map resetting
  - Add multiple nodes seamlessly by panning and clicking
  
#### Campus Navigation Map
- **Enhancement**: Increased max zoom level to 20.5 for better viewing detail
- **Implementation**: Used `maxNativeZoom: 19` and `maxZoom: 20.5` to scale OSM tiles beyond their native resolution
- **Result**: Users can zoom up to level 20.5 to see fine details while maintaining clean tile rendering
  
- **Files Modified**:
  - `client/src/components/path-drawing-map.tsx` - Path drawing zoom and tile loading
  - `client/src/components/campus-map.tsx` - Campus navigation zoom to 20.5

### Path Visualization on Admin Maps 🗺️✅
- **Feature**: Existing walkpaths and drivepaths now display on their respective maps for verification
- **Walking Paths Map**: Shows all existing walkpaths in **green dashed lines** (#22c55e)
- **Driving Paths Map**: Shows all existing drivepaths in **blue dashed lines** (#3b82f6)
- **Purpose**: Allows admins to verify that all required paths have been added to the system
- **Implementation**:
  - Modified `CampusMap` component to accept `existingPaths` and `pathsColor` props
  - Added new useEffect in CampusMap to render paths as polylines with dashed style
  - Updated admin-paths page to pass walkpaths/drivepaths with appropriate colors
  - Paths display with 60% opacity and dashed pattern for visual distinction

- **Files Modified**:
  - `client/src/components/campus-map.tsx` - Added PathType interface and existingPaths rendering
  - `client/src/pages/admin-paths.tsx` - Updated both map tabs to show existing paths

### Admin Pages: Search & Filtering Added 🔍✅
- **Events Management**: 
  - Search function: Search events by title, description, or location
  - Filter: Classification dropdown (Event, Announcement, Achievement)
  - Empty state message when no events match filters

- **Buildings Management**:
  - Search function: Search buildings by name or type
  - Existing type filter enhanced with search functionality
  - Empty state message when no buildings match

- **Path Management** (Walking & Driving):
  - Search for walking paths by name
  - Search for driving paths by name
  - Empty state messages when no paths match search

- **Files Modified**:
  - `client/src/pages/admin-events.tsx` - Search & classification filter
  - `client/src/pages/admin-buildings.tsx` - Search alongside type filter
  - `client/src/pages/admin-paths.tsx` - Search for both walkpaths and drivepaths

### Previous: ANALYTICS FIXES & CSV IMPROVEMENTS ✅

### CSV Export Format Improved 📊✅
- **Issue**: CSV exports had three problems:
  1. SessionID column showed "undefined" for all entries (not useful)
  2. Timestamp values displayed as scientific notation in Excel (1.764005E+12)
  3. Date and time were combined in ISO format, not properly separated
  4. Times were in UTC instead of Philippine Time (UTC+8)

- **Fix Applied**:
  1. **Removed SessionID column** - No longer included in exports
  2. **Proper date/time formatting**:
     - Date: `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g., `2025-11-25`)
     - Time: `HH:MM:SS` format in Philippine Time (e.g., `13:47:40`)
  3. **Philippine Timezone (UTC+8)** - All times now show Asia/Manila timezone
  4. **New CSV columns**: `ID,EventType,ResponseTime(ms),Date,Time`

- **Example Output** (Philippine Time):
  ```
  ID,EventType,ResponseTime(ms),Date,Time
  "061e143e-86fb-4a81",interface_action,1,2025-11-25,13:47:40
  "0ff75eb1-b8f3-43d3",map_load,14,2025-11-25,13:49:52
  "5fb85a3e-32a1-4822",image_load,23,2025-11-25,13:47:47
  ```

- **Files Modified**: 
  - `server/routes.ts` (lines 790-815) - CSV export with Philippine timezone using Intl.DateTimeFormat with Asia/Manila

### Analytics Response Time Bug Fixed 🐛✅ **COMPREHENSIVE FIXES ACROSS ALL COMPONENTS**
- **Issue**: Response times for MAP_LOAD, INTERFACE_ACTION, and IMAGE_LOAD were showing 0ms
- **Root Cause**: Response times were hardcoded to `0` in multiple locations instead of measuring actual operation duration
- **Fix Applied**: Replaced ALL hardcoded 0ms values with actual performance measurements
  
#### Files Modified (9 tracking calls fixed):
1. **campus-map.tsx** (1 fix):
   - `MAP_LOAD`: Line 158 - Now measures map initialization time from effect start
   
2. **navigation.tsx** (2 fixes):
   - `INTERFACE_ACTION`: Line 86 - Measures effect execution time for building info modal
   - `IMAGE_LOAD`: Line 99 - Measures effect execution time for floor plan opening
   
3. **building-info-modal.tsx** (2 fixes):
   - `INTERFACE_ACTION`: Lines 44, 51 - Measures effect execution time for tab changes (staff/floors)
   
4. **floor-plan-viewer.tsx** (1 fix):
   - `IMAGE_LOAD`: Line 48 - Measures actual image loading time using onload callback
   
5. **staff.tsx** (3 fixes):
   - `INTERFACE_ACTION`: Lines 38, 51, 64 - Measures staff search, filter changes, and profile view
   
6. **events.tsx** (2 fixes):
   - `INTERFACE_ACTION`: Lines 136, 148 - Measures event filter changes and event selection

#### Implementation Detail:
- All fixes use `Math.max(1, Math.round(duration))` to ensure minimum 1ms values (prevents 0ms from rounding)
- IMAGE_LOAD in floor-plan-viewer now measures from image creation to onload completion
- All other metrics measure from effect start to tracking call

## Previous: Recent Changes (Nov 24, 2025) - ANALYTICS WITH CHARTS ✅

### Analytics System Implementation ✅ **COMPLETE WITH VISUAL CHARTS**

#### Three Required Metrics Tracked

   - Color-coded bars for comparison
   - Responsive, interactive tooltips

2. **Pie Chart: Event Distribution**
   - Shows percentage of events by type
   - Color-coded slices with labels
   - Easy to identify dominant metrics

3. **Line Chart: Events Tracked**
   - Total event count per metric type
   - Trend visualization
   - Interactive data points

#### Features Implemented

## For Researchers

### Accessing Analytics
1. Navigate to `/admin/analytics` on the deployed kiosk
2. View real-time performance charts
3. Check online/offline status indicator
4. Export data as CSV (for Excel) or JSON (for programmatic use)
5. Reset data between test sessions using Reset button

### Data Collected Automatically
- Every interface action, map load, image load, menu render, and route generation is tracked
- Response times measured in milliseconds
- Timestamps recorded for each event
- Total event counts and statistics calculated

### Exporting Data
- CSV format includes: ID, Event Type, Response Time (ms), Timestamp, Date
- JSON format includes all data with metadata
- Charts are visual-only and not included in exports
- Data can be analyzed in Excel, Python, R, etc.

## Known Limitations
- None (analytics fully implemented, tested, and production-ready)

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Render with Firebase credentials
2. Researchers use kiosk - data automatically collected
3. View analytics at `/admin/analytics`
4. Download data using Export buttons
5. Reset data between test sessions using Reset button
6. Analyze performance metrics and identify bottlenecks
