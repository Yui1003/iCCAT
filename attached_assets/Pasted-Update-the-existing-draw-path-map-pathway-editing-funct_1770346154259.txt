Update the existing draw path / map pathway editing functionality of our web application to behave like OpenStreetMap’s way editor.

⚠️ This is an enhancement of an existing feature, not a full rewrite.
Keep the current map setup, UI layout, and data flow unless changes are required for correct behavior.

Required Behavior Updates
1. Live Connecting Line (Critical)

While in Draw Path Mode, always show a live “rubber-band” connecting line

This line must connect:
the most recently placed node → the current mouse cursor

The line must update in real time on mouse movement

When the next node is placed, the preview line becomes a permanent segment

2. Node Placement & Continuity

First click creates the start node

Each additional click:

Adds a new node

Extends the polyline from the previous node

The path must always extend from the latest node, never restart from earlier nodes

3. Centered End Marker

The latest node (end node) must:

Be visually distinct

Be perfectly centered on its coordinate

Not appear offset due to incorrect icon anchoring

When drawing is finished, keep a final end marker centered on the last node

4. Node Editing

Nodes remain draggable

Dragging a node updates connected line segments in real time

Allow undoing the last placed node

5. Finish & Cancel Behavior

Double-click or press Finish Drawing to finalize the path

Disable drawing interactions after finishing

Re-enable normal map panning

Visual & Interaction Rules

Active path color similar to OpenStreetMap editor (blue)

Live preview line should be lighter or dashed

Disable map dragging while drawing

Data Handling

Continue using the current path storage logic

Ensure the final path is stored/exported as a GeoJSON LineString

Code Expectations

Modify only what is necessary

Keep the existing architecture and naming conventions

Add comments explaining new or changed logic

Goal

The updated draw-path experience should feel nearly identical to OpenStreetMap, especially:

Continuous line extension from the latest node

Live cursor-connected preview line

Precisely centered end marker
