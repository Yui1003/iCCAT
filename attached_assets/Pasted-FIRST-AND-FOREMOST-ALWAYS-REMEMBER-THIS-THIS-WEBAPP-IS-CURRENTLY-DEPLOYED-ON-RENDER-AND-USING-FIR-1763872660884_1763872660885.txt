FIRST AND FOREMOST, ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS:
THIS WEBAPP IS CURRENTLY DEPLOYED ON RENDER AND USING FIREBASE DATABASE. IM CURRENTLY USING THE DEPLOYED WEBAPP WHEN PROMPTING TO YOU. IM USING THE REPLIT ENVIRONMENT FOR TESTING OUT THE CHANGES BEFORE PUSHING IT TO THE DEPLOYED WEBSITE.

1. Navigation Completion Restriction

Currently, after clicking “Journey Complete” on mobile, a feedback dialog appears.

If they select “Yes”, they go to the feedback form.

If they select “No”, instead of returning to the homepage, redirect them to a dedicated "Thank You"page.

Required Change:

After completing a navigation session, mobile users must not be able to access the landing page or any other part of the app.
Instead, redirect them to a dedicated “Thank You” page, containing a message such as:

“Thank you for using the kiosk. To navigate again, please return to the physical kiosk.”

Users should not be able to return to the homepage from this page. This ensures they must use the kiosk again to start a new session.

2. Feedback Submission Restriction

Right now, when users finish the feedback form on mobile, the app redirects them back to the homepage.

Required Change:

After submitting feedback, mobile users must also be redirected to the same “Thank You” page, instead of the homepage.

Both the navigation completion flow and the feedback flow must lead to this restricted page.

3. Mobile-Only Restriction

All the restrictions above must apply only to the mobile QR-code version.
The kiosk (desktop) version should remain unchanged and fully accessible.

4. Mobile Map Integration

Currently, the navigation map is only visible in the desktop/kiosk view.
On mobile, users cannot see the map while navigating.

Required Change:

Enable the navigation map to appear on the mobile (QR) version.
The preferred layout:

The map is displayed by default on the mobile screen.

A button on the left can slide in or slide out the navigation info panel (showing the route, steps, etc.).

This allows mobile users to view the map while still accessing navigation instructions when needed.

This update ensures that mobile users have the same visual navigation aid as kiosk users.
